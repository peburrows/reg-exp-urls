-------------------------

== Description

An extension to make links and urls in your pages much less fragile.

== Usage

the 'matches' attribute is required, and is a regular expression to be tested
against the pages in your site. similar to the standard <r:find url="/path" />
except this tag uses regular expressions instead of absolutes.

<r:finder:url:link matches="/about$" />
<r:finder:url:html_link matches="/support$" />
